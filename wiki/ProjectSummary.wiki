Mip.!ShellArgs.Parser is a parser for command line / shell arguments which are usually passed to the {{{static void Main(string[] args)}}} method in shell programs.

While being very [GettingStarted easy to use], it is also very flexible via its fluent API. Simple programs may require only a single line.

Name and aliases of options can be customized as well as if they are required or not.

It supports many of the [SupportedTypes standard .NET types] as {{{ string, bool, int, float, DateTime, TimeSpan }}} but also enums, collections and you can even add converters for your custom types.

Arguments can be parsed to instances of custom classes or call event handlers.

Even a help string is automatically generated which can be used to display the usage of your program.
